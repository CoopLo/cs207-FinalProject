    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) is a method for numerically finding the derivative of a function at a given point. It can be used to find derivatives of complex functions where computing the symbolic derivative can be impossible or computationally costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation is more accurate than other numerical differentiation methods such as the [finite difference method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method). The finite difference method attempts to find the derivative of a function at a given point by adding a small perturbation ($\\epsilon$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{f(x+\\epsilon) - f(x)}{\\epsilon} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the perturbation is too large, the estimate for the derivative is not accurate. When the perturbation is too small, it starts to amplify floating point errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation achieves high accuracy while avoiding amplified floating point errors by (1) breaking down the function into a sequence of elementary functions (e.g., sin, cos, log, and exp), (2) calculating the exact derivation of these elementary functions, (3) and finally combining them using the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule), the [product rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule), and simple mathematical operations (such as addition and multiplication). \n",
    "\n",
    "Given its speed and precision, automatic differentiation is popular within the field of computational science where it has numerous applications. This software package as an implementation of automatic differentiation using Python.\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation allows us to compute the true analytic derivative of a function to machine precision. At a high level, this is done by breaking down complex functions into their elementary components and propogating their derivative via the chain rule. Other methods of finding derivatives include symbolic differentiation and finite fifference. Symbolic differentiation is also accurate to machine precision but is more computationally costly and its implementation is more complex. Finite difference is easier and less costly to implement but can quickly lead to floating point errors. As such, automatic differentiation is a more precise and lightweight methodology to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "The [product rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule) is used to find the derivative of the product of two or more functions. In its simplest form, if $f$ and $g$ are functions, the derivative of their product is given by the following equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ [f(x)g(x)]' = f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule is used for computing the derivative of the composition of two or more functions. In its simplest form, if $f$ and $g$ are functions, the derivative of their composition is given by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ [f(g(x))]' = f'(g(x))*g'(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modes of Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "The automatic differentiation method can be implemented in two ways depending on how the chain rule is utilized. Consider the formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = g_3(g_2(g_1(x))) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the chain rule, this function's derivative at point $x = a$ is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f'(a) = g_3'(.)*g_2'(.)*g_1'(a) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward mode of automatic differentiation recursively propagates the calculated derivative from the right: first calculates $g_1'(a)$, then $g_2'(.)$, then $g_3'(.)$, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse mode of automatic differentiation recursively propagates the calculated derivative from the left: first calculates $g_3'(.)$, then $g_2'(.)$, then $g_1'(a)$, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation, we will focus on the forward mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Forward Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful tool associated with the forward mode is the computational trace. Using the computational trace, we can list the steps required to go from input values (the point at which the derivative is evaluated) to the input function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = sin(e^{2x}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we want to evaluate the derivative of this function at $x = 5$. The steps for calculating the derivative using forward mode are given in the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Trace | Elementary Function | Function Value | Derivative | Derivative Value |\n",
    "| :------: | :----------: | :-------: | :---------: | :--------: |\n",
    "| $x_{1}$ | $x$ | 5 | $\\dot{x}_{1}$ | $1$ |\n",
    "| $x_{2}$ | $2x_{1}$ | $10$ | $2\\dot{x}_{1}$ | $2$ |\n",
    "| $x_{3}$ | $e^{x_{2}}$ | $e^{10}$ | $e^{x_{2}}\\dot{x}_{2}$ | $2e^{10}$ |\n",
    "| $x_{4}$ | $sin(x_{3})$ | $sin(e^{10})$ | $cos(x_{3})\\dot{x}_{3}$ | $2e^{10}cos(e^{10})$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "We get the required derivative value $2e^{10}cos(e^{10})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dual Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilize [dual numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number) in our implementation of the forward mode of automatic differentiation. Dual numbers are an extension to real numbers (similar to complex numbers). Dual numbers introduce a new element (typically represented by $\\epsilon$) with the useful property $\\epsilon^2 = 0$.  Using dual numbers and [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series), we can find the derivative of a function quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a function $f$ and we want to find its derivative at point $x = a$. We will set $x = a + b\\epsilon$ and find the Taylor expansion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(a+b\\epsilon) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(b\\epsilon)^nf^{(n)}(a)}{n!} = f(a) + b\\epsilon f'(a) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "All higher-order terms are equal to $0$ because of the dual number property $\\epsilon^2 = 0$. For function $f$, we get its derivative at point $x = a$ directly from the second term in the Taylor expansion.\n",

    "# How To Use\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "In thinking through how to use our software package, we considered the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who are our users?\n",
    "We decided to target somewhat tech-savvy users who would be comfortable with a command line application as opposed to a more approachable and user-friendly GUI. Any single user should be able to install the package easily onto their machine without requiring broader deployment. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where should it run? \n",
    "We expect our package to be installed and run on any desktop devices through the command line. It should work regardless of the operating system as long as the user has Python on their machine (our assumption is that most users will have Python pre-installed on their Mac or Linux machines or will be able to easily download it otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packaging Choice\n",
    "We plan to use pip as the package manager. We considered some other options such as conda install but ultimately chose pip because Python developers are already familiar with it and we did not want the installation process to be a barrier to using our program. We plan to register the name of our package on PyPI and upload source distributions via the setup.py file. To ensure that our package can be downloaded regardless of the userâ€™s Python version, we plan to use pip instead of pip3. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation via GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "To install our package from GitHub, a user should enter the following in the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new virtual environment (using Conda):\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create --name test`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Activate virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda activate test`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Clone our source code:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git clone https://github.com/make-AD-ifference/cs207-FinalProject.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Change current directory to the cloned repo:\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd cs207-FinalProject/`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Install dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Start up Python and import AutoDiff class:\n",
    "\n",
    "`>>> python`\n",
    "\n",
    "`>>> from autodiff.autodiff import AutoDiff`\n",
    "\n",
    "`>>> x = AutoDiff(2,3)`\n",

    "\n",
    "`>>> f`\n",
    "\n",
    "`AutoDiff(4,12)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**[See Implementation section below for further details on using AutoDiff]**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Finally, quit Python and deactivate environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "`>>>exit()`\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda deactivate`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation via pip (to be implemented)\n",
    "\n",
    "To install our package, a user should enter the following in the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install make_ad_ifference` \n",
    "(assuming \"make_ad_ifference\" is our root directory name)\n",
    "\n",
    "`import autodiff`\n",
    "(\"autodiff\" is a placeholder for the name of our main sub directory that will contain all our classes)\n",

The AutoDiff class will keep track of the trace value and the derivative of functions for each input variable. It will have two attributes `val` and `der` which represent the value and the derivative respecitvely. We will have a set of elementary functions that can easily be expanded. These elementary functions will serve as building blocks for users to assemble the function they wish to evaluate.\n",
